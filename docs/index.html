    <h1>Jarmon User Guide</h1>
    <p>Jarmon is a browser based graph rendering system.

    <h2 id="browser-compatibility">Browser Compatibility</h2>
    <p>Jarmon depends upon the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/">Flot
    graphing library</a> which makes use of the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-canvas-element.html">HTML5 canvas
    element</a>. The canvas element is only supported in certain web browsers.

    <h3>Internet Explorer Caveats</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Internet Explorer (&lt;= IE8)
        <dd>This version of IE does not have native support the HTML canvas (see
        Internet Explorer workarounds below)
        element.

        <dt>Internet Explorer 9
        <dd>Due to be released in late 2010 this new version of IE will provide
        <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/06/23/html5-native-third-ie9-platform-preview-available-for-developers.aspx">
        native canvas support</a> and will be able to render Jarmon graphs as
        fast (if not faster) than other browsers.
    </dl>

    <h3>Internet Explorer Workarounds</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Excanvas
        <dd>This is the default IE compatibility workaround. Jarmon bundles the
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/">excanvas library</a>
        which translates canvas api calls into VML, but this is much slower
        than the native canvas support in other browsers. In the absense of
        other workarounds, Jarmon will transparently use the excanvas library.

        <dt>Chrome Frame
        <dd><a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">Chrome
        Frame</a> is an IE plugin developed by Google. Once installed, it
        replaces the standard IE rendering module with the more performant
        Chrome rendering module.</dd>
        <dd>When first visiting a Jarmon page using &lt;= IE8, you will be
        prompted with an advisory message, explaining the performance penalty of
        using the standard excanvas compatibility layer.
        <dd>You will be asked whether you want to Install and use Chrome Frame.
        You will be presented with the following options:
            <dl>
                <dt>Yes
                <dd>After you choose this option the message will be hidden and
                you will be guided through the steps necessary to install
                Chrome Frame after which you can continue to use Jarmon
                normally.</dd>
                <dt>Remind me later
                <dd>After you choose this option, the message will be hidden
                and you can continue to use Jarmon.</dd>
                <dd>Your preference will be saved in a cookie and the warning
                message will not re-appear for 1 month.</dd>
                <dt>Never
                <dd>After you choose this option, the message will be hidden
                and you can continue to use Jarmon.</dd>
                <dd>Your preference will be saved in a cookie and the warning
                message will never re-appear (unless the preference cookie is
                deleted or expires).</dd>
